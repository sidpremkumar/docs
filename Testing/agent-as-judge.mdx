Lytix supports evaluating agentic workflows. This means not only do we evaluate the input/output of the flow, but also can pass in a data source (e.g. repository) to further evaluate the output.

  **ðŸš¨ Prerequisite** Login & setup your `lytix` CLI [here](/CLI/cli-login).

## Create a Test Suite

The first step is to create a test suite. This is a group of tests that will be run together.

```bash
lytix agent-test create-suite --suiteName "suite0"
```

  controls
  className="w-full aspect-video"
  src="https://lytix-cdn.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/documentationAssets/agentAsJudge/agent-create-test-suite.mov"
  muted
  loop
  autoPlay

></video>

### Update `config.json`

After creating the test suite, you'll need to update the `config.json` file to define what repository you'd like to evaluate.

```json
{
  "repository": {
    "remote": "github",
    "branch": "main",
    "repository": "Lytix-Labs/optimodel"
  }
}
```

<Info>
  **Note** We currently only support public GitHub repositories. Please reach out to <a href="mailto:support@lytix.com">support@lytix.com</a> if you'd like to evaluate a private repository.
</Info>

## Create a Test in a Suite

```bash
lytix agent-test add-test --testName "test0" --suiteName "suite0"
```
<video
  controls
  className="w-full aspect-video"
  src="https://lytix-cdn.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/documentationAssets/agentAsJudge/agent-create-test-run.mov"
  muted
  loop
  autoPlay

></video>

### Update `start.py`

To collect test data, we want to allow full flexibility. Thus, we create a `start.py` file in the folder of the test. This file will be executed to collect the data.

The **only** requirement is that the `start.py` file prints the following JSON object to stdout:

```json
{
  "messages": ["..."],
  "output": "...",
  "sources": ["..."]
}
```

Where `messages` is an array of `{role: "user" | "assistant", content: "..."}` and `sources` is an array of file paths that contain the data we want to evaluate the output against.

<Info>
  **Note** Currently we only support a single `user` message.

## Run a Test Suite

```bash
lytix agent-test run --suiteName "suite0"
```
