You can setup and track a custom evaluation for your workflow creating a custom evaluation. The idea is to create a custom rubric to grade the conversation, and then track the results of that rubric over time to identify trends and issues.

After [setting up your workflow](/Workflows/workflows-setup). Headover to evaluations:
