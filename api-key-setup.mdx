## API Key Generation 

Head over to [Lytix platform](https://lytix.co/login) and navigate to the "Settings->API Keys" [page](https://lytix.co/home/settings/apiKeys/).

Click "New API Key" and give it a name to remember it (Note: the name _can_ be changed later)

Then click the options button to copy the API key to your clipboard

The API then should be copied directly to your clipboard.

## Environment Variable Setup

All Lytix SDKs use the `LX_API_KEY` environment variable to authenticate with the Lytix platform. 

You can set this environment variable in your local development environment by adding it to your `.env` file.

```bash
export LX_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

You can now continue to the [NodeJS](/nodejs-quickstart) or [Python](/python-quickstart) Quickstart.
