Workflows are ways to group and analyze your LLM data. Not all calls to a given model should be evaluated the same way, so workflows allow you to define different evaluation criteria for different models.

In addition to high level metrics, workflows also allow you to define custom evaluation criteria that you can use to evaluate your LLM data. 


### Setup A Workflow

Workflows are created when data is first pushed and tagged with a given workflow name. There are two ways to create a workflow:

1. Use an API key to automatically push data to a workflow. Learn more [here](/APIKeys/api-keys-and-workflows).

2. Use [Optimodel](/OptiModel/getting-started) to push data to a workflow (see code below)


```python
response = await queryModel(
    # Just set this field
    workflowName="test-workflow", 
    model=ModelTypes.llama_3_70b_instruct,
    messages=[
        ModelMessage(
            role="system",
            content="Always respond with a JSON object",
        ),
        ModelMessage(role="user", content=[
            ModelMessageContentEntry(type="text", text="Hello how are you again?"),
        ]),
    ],
)
```
