All Lytix SDKs use the `LX_API_KEY` environment variable to authenticate with the Lytix platform. 

You can set this environment variable in your local development environment by adding it to your `.env` file.

```bash
export LX_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

You can now continue to the [NodeJS](/nodejs-quickstart) or [Python](/python-quickstart) Quickstart.
