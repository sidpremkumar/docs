You can use API keys to automatically push all data from that API key to a single workflow.

After [setting up your API key](/api-key-setup), navigate to the [API key page](https://lab.lytix.co/home/settings/api-keys/) and click on the API key you have just created:

Then click the "Add Default Workflow" button:

Now you can add it to an existing workflow or create a new one:

After you use the API key to push data, it will automatically be sent to the workflow you have selected. You can see all your workflows [here](https://lab.lytix.co/home/workflows/)
