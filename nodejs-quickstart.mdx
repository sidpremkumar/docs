Install the Lytix NPM package

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i @lytix/client
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @lytix/client
```

</CodeGroup>

## Express Analytic Collection

Lytix provides an out of the box middleware that you can use to collect data from your NodeJS (Express) project.

To get started, simply add the middleware to your Express app.

```ts
import { AnalyticRequestHandler } from "@lytix/client";

....
const app = express();
...

/**
 * Create a logger and give it a name. Whenever you log with this (anywhere
 * in your application). The logs will automatically be be pushed to Lytix 
 * when a non-200 status code is returned.
 */
export const logger = new LLogger("main");

/**
 * Pass the logger in as the 4th argument here
 */
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  return AnalyticRequestHandler(req, res, next, logger);
});

/**
 * The rest is the same
 */
```

You now have basic metric collection setup. Requests will be published with the `requestDuration` metric name

### Collect Trace Logs

Lytix also supports pushing logs to the Lytix platform. Under the hood this is done by using the HTTP request context to bundle the logs and push them to the Lytix platform when a non-200 status code is returned.

To do this update the code as follows: 

```ts 
import { AnalyticRequestHandler } from "@lytix/client";

....
const app = express();
...

/**
 * Add our HTTP context
 */
app.use(httpContext.middleware);


/**
 * This handle is used to push basic HTTP metrics along with
 * any errors and their traces
 */
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  return AnalyticRequestHandler(req, res, next);
});
```

If done correctltly, you will be able to see the logs in the Lytix platform.

### Add metadata to the logs

You can also add metadata to the logs by adding it to the HTTP context. This is useful if you want to add metadata to the logs that is not automatically captured. Metadata set will _always_ be logged. 

```ts
...
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  /**
   * Lets say we auth the user and get their UID
   */
  mmLogger.setMetadata({ key: "userId", value: "123" });
  next();
});
...
```

## LLM Model Input Output Collection

Lytix supports automatically collecting the input and output of LLM models. To do this you can use the following

```ts
import { MetricCollector } from "@lytix/client";

await MetricCollector.captureModelIO(
  "testModelName",
  "Some user input",
  "Some model output",
  {
    /**
     * Optional extra data
     */
    env: "prod",
  }
);
```

Lytix will automatically process the input and output of the LLM model and push the metrics to the Lytix platform. You can see your model metrics in the Lytix platform [here](https://lytix.co/home/llm/).

### LLM Model Trace Collection

Lytix also support capturing trace information (e.g. duration) for the LLM model. To do this you can use the following

```ts
import { MetricCollector } from "@lytix/client";

const response = await MetricCollector.captureModelTrace(
  "testModelName",
  "Some user input",
  async () => {
    const openai = new OpenAI();
    ...
    /**
     * This callback is expecting the model output to be returned
     */
    return response;
  }
);
```

You'll now see the model duration trace in the Lytix platform [here](https://lytix.co/home/llm/).

## Manual Metric Collection

You always have the option to manually push metrics to the Lytix platform with custom names and metadata. 

The following example pushes a metric to the Lytix platform with the name `testMetic` and the value `1` along with the `env: prod` metadata. 

```ts
import { MetricCollector } from "@lytix/client";

await MetricCollector.increment("testMetic", 1, { env: "prod" });
```

You then have access to that on the Lytix platform and can filter on any of the metadata passed.
