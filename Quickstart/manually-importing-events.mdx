You can manually import events and pass them through a custom evaluation. This can be helpful if you want to batch process a set of events to get their custom evaluation results.

### JSON Format

The import expects the following list format if you are uploading a JSON file.

```json
[
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "string",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "string",
                        "text": "string",
                        "source": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "mediaType": "string",
                            "data": "string"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "model": "string"
    },
    ...
]
```
