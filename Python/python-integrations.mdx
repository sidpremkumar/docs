<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Please see [here](/api-key-setup) to get and set your API Key environment variable.
</Info>

Install the Lytix pip package


```bash
pip3 install lytix-py
```

*Make sure to set your API key e.g. `export LX_API_KEY=...`*

## Helicone

To integrate with Helicone, just wrap your calls with our wrapper. For example if **you start with** this code:


```py
from openai import OpenAI
import os

openAIClient = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ.get(
        "OPENAI_API_KEY", "sk-1234"
    ),
    base_url="https://oai.hconeai.com/v1",  # Helicone API endpoint
    default_headers= { 
        "Helicone-Auth": f"Bearer 5678",  # Helicone auth
    }
)

...
response = openAIClient.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"},
    ],
    max_tokens=50
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

You just need to wrap your calls with our decorator and you're all set!

```py
@lytix.trace
def askQuestion(input: str) -> str:
  response = openAIClient.chat.completions.create(
      model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages=[
          {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
          {"role": "user", "content": input},
      ],
      max_tokens=50
  )
  return response.choices[0].message.content

print(askQuestion("What is the capital of France?"))
```

The dectorator expected a input `input` that is parsed as the input to the interaction, and the return type is a `str` that is parsed as the output of the interactions. These are what Lytix uses to process the interaction.
