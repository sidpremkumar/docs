To get started pushing metrics to Posthog, you'll need to pull your Project API Key so Lytix can push data to Posthog. You can find this here: `https://us.posthog.com/project/$MY_PROJECT_ID/settings/project-details`. Replace `$MY_PROJECT_ID` with your PostHog project.

Now upload your API key to the Lytix platform [here](https://lab.lytix.co/home/settings/posthog/)
