The playground can be used both to debug existing events or start experimenting with new prompts across multiple models. 

<Info>
    You must configure at least one model provider [here](https://lab.lytix.co/home/settings/model-providers/) in order for the playground to work.

At the top left you can select between different models and providers. Selecting multiple will allow you to compare outputs across different models.
