Passing images to any model uses the OpenAIs syntax. Underneath we'll convert the syntax for the model you're using.

```py Python
import base64

# Encode the image to base64
with open("some.png", "rb") as image_file:
    encoded_string = base64.b64encode(image_file.read())
    encoded_string = encoded_string.decode('utf-8')

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        ...
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "whats this image?"},
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{encoded_string}"
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
    ],
)
```

Then you can switch to a model such as `claude-3-5-sonnet` and pass the image in with no code changes.

```py Python
from optimodel_server_types import ModelTypes,

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=ModelTypes.claude_3_5_sonnet.name,
    messages=[
      # Same as above
      ...
    ],
)
```
