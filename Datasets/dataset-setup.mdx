Datasets are ways to group and save LLM interactions. You can use datasets to save important interactions, or start to create a library of events to use for training, evaluation, and more.

## Creating a Dataset

You can create a dataset in the UI by going to the datasets tab and clicking the "Create Dataset" button.

## Manually Adding Interactions to a Dataset

You can manually add single interactions to a dataset by clicking the "Add to Dataset" button on an interaction and selecting a dataset.

## Automatically Adding Certain Evaluations to a Dataset

You can automatically add certain evaluations to a dataset by setting up a rule on the evaluation itself.

This will automatically add evaluations that meet the given critera to the dataset. This is helpful if you are trying to collect data to fine tune a model

## Webhook On Dataset Add/Remove

You can setup a webhook to be called when an interaction is added to a dataset. This is useful if you are trying store data in an external system.

You can do this by clicking the dataset settings, and entering a webhook URL.

The body of the webhook is as follows:

```json
{
  "modelId": "string",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "string",
      "content": "string" | "array"
    }
  ],
  "action": "ADDED" | "REMOVED"
}
```
